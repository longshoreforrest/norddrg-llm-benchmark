# NordDRG‑AI Benchmark for Large‑Language Models

**Transparent, reproducible evaluation of Diagnosis‑Related Group (DRG) reasoning in modern LLMs**

---

## 🚀 Overview

This repository packages everything needed to reproduce the experiments described in our accompanying paper — *from raw NordDRG rule tables to a ready‑made prompt/answer set and evaluation scripts*.

The benchmark tests whether large‑language models can correctly reason over the complex classification logic used for hospital funding in the Nordic countries. It includes full DRG logic tables, governance manuals, and a set of 14 case-based tasks targeting code lookup, cross-table inference, and qualitative audits.

All artefacts are described in detail in the [arXiv paper (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/xxx).

### Notes

* **Grouper specification versions** — Each folder like `NordDRG_Combined2024PL` corresponds to a specific DRG version. New versions (e.g. 2025, 2026) should be added in their own directories to preserve reproducibility across releases.
* **Benchmark Q\&A file** — `NordDRG Benchmark Questions – 2025-06-11.xlsx` includes 14 prompts (IDs 1–14) spanning both quantitative and qualitative tasks, plus the gold-standard answer key in one consolidated Excel file.
* **PDF Manuals** — The two PDF documents explain how to read NordDRG definition tables and how to format technical change proposals, enabling evaluation of governance-aware model outputs.

## 📊 Evaluation metric

The official score is **macro-averaged accuracy** across the 9 quantitative DRG assignment tasks (IDs 1–9). A response is considered **correct** if it matches the gold DRG codes exactly (case-insensitive, unordered). Tasks 10–14 are evaluated qualitatively based on explanation quality and guideline adherence.

## 🧪 Demonstration summary

A demonstration included in the preprint evaluates five proprietary LLMs (GPT-4o, o3, o4-mini-high, Gemini Pro, Gemini Flash) against the benchmark. Results confirm that the NordDRG benchmark captures cross-model variance invisible to general NLP leaderboards, especially on multilingual and governance-based tasks.
